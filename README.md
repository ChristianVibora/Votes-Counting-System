# Votes-Counting-System
This is the code for my votes clunting system in C#. This system was used in the 2016 elections. The system uses GSMComm library for sending and receiving SMS using a device called GSM modem. This system display the vote counts faster than the COMELEC counting because the system receives input directly from individual precinct outputs.
